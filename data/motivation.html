<p>Hello! My name is Keonhyeong Kim studying economics in South Korea.</p>
<p>This is a website for a personal project to share my data of Korean economy, especially financial ones for some factor models like the Single Index Model or Fama-French 3 Factor Model. When I was on bachelor course in economics, I tried to practice factor models using <strong>Korean Market Risk Premium, SMB, or HML data</strong>. But I found that there were no websites to easily get that kind of Korean ones. <strong>Even</strong> it was so hard to get enough <strong>PRICE data</strong> to be applied on the models.</p>
<img src="databetter.jpg" width="100%">
<p>So I decided to make a website for anyone to easily get those of data files available free of charge, benchmarking <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html" target="_blank">French's data library</a>, and just this webiste is. I'm going to upload not only data files with the source codes, but also concise explains for the models. So don't trust me and please check out the source codes.</p>
